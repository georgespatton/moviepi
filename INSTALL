moviepi, a way to display all your movies/videos randomly from a directory search on your Raspberry Pi.  

Environment:

I used a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an 8GB SD card running the latest Raspbian and Python 3.

Install:

cd 

git clone https://github.com/georgespatton/moviepi

cd moviepi

sudo cp rc.local /etc/rc.local

sudo reboot

This will install the wrapper to start once Rasbian starts.  Change the walk_dir parameter in gather_files.py to change the parent directory of where your video files live.  I only have .mp4 files, but you can add additional extensions in gather_files.py if you want to search for more file extensions. 

Also see https://github.com/georgespatton/picturepi for another similar program I wrote for a picture display frame.
